# Raphael

## Idea

Several web pages allow one to upload images and tag them for easier find. Raphael now allows you, in one lightweight application, to do this on your home machine.

## Features

These will be few and simple:

* Scan images from directories
* Tag them
* Find images by tags
* Slideshow them

Images will be sorted in a database.
